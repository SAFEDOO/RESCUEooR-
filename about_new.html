        <p>Welcome to our Animal Organization! We are a compassionate team dedicated to improving the lives of animals everywhere. Our mission is to protect and care for animals while promoting their rights and fostering harmony between humans and animals.</p>
        <p>At International Animal Rescue we not only save animals from suffering, we also rehabilitate and release them back into the wild and work to protect their precious natural habitats. Our work includes cutting free and caring for captive bears in India and Armenia, rescuing and rehabilitating orangutans and other primates in Indonesia and treating injured and orphaned howler monkeys in Costa Rica. Our aim is to return animals to their natural environment wherever possible, but we also provide a permanent home for those that can no longer fend for themselves. As human populations expand, wildlife comes under increasing threat. By rescuing individual animals belonging to species like the orangutan and reintroducing them into protected areas in the wild, our work also plays a role in the conservation of the species as a whole.</p>

            <p>At GHAR, we are dedicated to rescuing and providing a second chance for animals in need. Whether it's abandoned, neglected, or injured animals, we strive to give them a safe haven and the care they deserve. Our goal is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome animals into loving, forever homes, while also raising awareness about animal welfare and the importance of compassion for all living beings.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">What We Do</h1>
        <p> Our work involves more than just rescuing animals. We are a full-service organization that provides:<p>
        <ul>
            <li> <span>Rescue & Rehabilitation:</span> We respond to calls for help, rescue animals from dangerous situations, and provide the medical care, nutrition, and emotional support they need to recover.</li>
            <li> <span> Adoption:</span> We carefully match animals with loving homes, ensuring they go to families who will offer them the care, attention, and affection they need.</li>
            <li><span>Foster Care:</span>Our foster program allows animals to live in temporary, loving homes while they await adoption, giving them a chance to heal and thrive in a safe environment.</li>
            <li> <span>Education & Advocacy:</span> We believe in empowering the public through education about animal welfare, responsible pet ownership, and the importance of spaying and neutering. We also advocate for better laws and policies to protect animals from cruelty.</li>
            <li><span>Spay&Neuter Programs:</span>We partner with local veterinarians and clinics to offer low-cost or free spay/neuter services to the community. By preventing unwanted litters, we reduce the number of animals that end up in shelters, saving countless lives. Our spay/neuter initiatives are part of a broader effort to manage the pet population responsibly and ensure that every animal is given the opportunity to live a healthy, happy life.</li>
        </ul>
